# Geopolitics Google Sentiment Indicator

This project is an algorithm for making Geopolitics Google Sentiment Indicator. The motivation for this project is geopolitics is a crucial factor in investing nowadays given rising dollar index and policy uncertainities by large economies of the world. We scrape data from Google Trends website for the identified geopolitical words, clean and organize the SVI values, winsorized, deseasonalized and normalized the values to calculte sentiment index. 

The algorithm is designed as per user requirements and the data can be cleaned and organized as per the user requirements. The data download of SVI values is super tricky from api or website, paid proxy servers with progressive time lags in between data downloads are applied. The calculated sentiment indicator have positive correlation with the calculated Geopolitics indicator research paper values, "Measuring Geopolitical Risk", Dario Caldera and Matteo Iacoviello.

The algorithms are for weekly and monthly data both.

Also data extraction from API and data cleaning and modelling are also attached.
